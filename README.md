# Emotional-Communication
This innovative app, Project Emotional Messaging, uses icons overlaid on messages to visually represent the emotion behind the words. 
It's a novel way to bring more depth and context to our digital conversations.

When conversing through a virtual medium such as social media or messaging services, our messages are often prone to being misunderstood. 
Our intentions and the emotions we convey can get lost in translation. 

I hope to change this, or inspire someone else to do so, through SOMSET or another application. 

My aim is to create something that will overlay existing messages with colours, symbols, and perhaps emojis, in an attempt 
to clarify and enhance the emotional context of our communication.

We'll utilize colours to express emotions and intentionsâ€”since we naturally link emotions with colors. With this in mind, 
we'll offer a default guide and potentially supply an editable template with alternate text explaining the expressed emotion.

Major emotions will correspond to major colours, and emotions related to these major ones will be variations of the associated colour. 

For instance, anger is red, calm is blue, happy is yellow, neutral is green, etc.

We'll employ icons I've designed to signify specific emotions, intentions, and other meanings. Each icon will include 
alt text explaining its significance, but over time, people will become familiar with these simple icons. 

We might incorporate existing icons or emojis to aid in expression without restricting current forms of expression, 
but the interpretation of meaning will be left to the sender and receiver.
