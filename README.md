# Emotional-Communication
This innovative app, Project Emotional Messaging, uses icons overlaid on messages to visually represent the emotion behind the words. 
It's a novel way to bring more depth and context to our digital conversations.

When conversing through a virtual medium such as social media or messaging services, our messages are often prone to being misunderstood. 
Our intentions and the emotions we convey can get lost in translation. 

I hope to change this, or inspire someone else to do so, through SOMSET or another application. 

My aim is to create something that will overlay existing messages with colours, symbols, and perhaps emojis, in an attempt 
to clarify and enhance the emotional context of our communication.
